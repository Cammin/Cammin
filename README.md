### Hi there 👋

My name is Cameron Krebbers. I love the idea of making games.  
I'm mainly experienced in the Unity engine, but also past experience with GameMaker Studio 2 and Clickteam Fusion 2.5.

- 🌥️ I strive to make fun game experiences!
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [LDtkToUnity](https://github.com/Cammin/LDtkUnity) with the goal to make my own game with it.
- 🌱 I have many learning/research goals. To improve on programming & design, and to pick up on making good music & art!
- 🎮 In my pastime, I like playing games or watching Youtube.
- 📫 I can be reached at `cameo221@gmail.com`, or on Discord at `Cammin#1689`.
- 🌎 I am from Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.
- 📆 I'm 23.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can only appreciate music if it's appeared in a video game. Weird but true.
- 🧠 Also fun fact: I have aspergers, which is a high-functioning autism.
